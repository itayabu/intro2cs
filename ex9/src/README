 ==================
=  Description:  =
==================
A program that contains 10 parts of the SpaceWars computer game:

(1) Implement the SpaceShip class in an abstract class according to its API. we decided to add methods that used to represent all the spaceships.
However all the spaceships subclasses overrides the implementation of the doAction() and getImage() methods of the SpaceShip.

(2) Implement the SpaceShipFactory class that is used by the driver to create all the spaceships
objects according to their type.

The next seven (3-9) classes implement the different types of spaceships. They all extend the SpaceShipclass.
Firstly the two that controlled by the player, then the rest:

(3) Implement the Human spaceship features according the rules 

(4) Implement the CrazyHuman spaceship features according the rules. 
This class extend Human class.

(5) Implement the Floater spaceship features according the rules.
A ship that floats around and does nothing.

(6) Implement the Runner spaceship features according the rules.
A ship that tries to avoid all other ships. Has a spying ability
that will be explained later.

(7) Implement the Basher spaceship features according the rules.
A ship that tries to collide with other ships.

(8) Implement the Aggressive spaceship features according the rules. 
A ship that tries to pursue and fire at other ships

(9) Implement the Special spaceship features that we define its behavior
. we built a spaceship that run in circles and doesn't stop to shoot

(10) General tests that check the basic methods of SpaceShip.
