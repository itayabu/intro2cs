======================
There are many Methods I created in this game, thinking this was the purpose of the excersice.
Also in some point I decided to put the GUI, Players and some integers as static "objects" or "fields"
in the class itself and not in a Method, so I wont have to call them in for every method.
Third, I put all Methods as private because I dont think anyone should look at them.
Forth (and last)- I reduced the comments by far, trying to make it look "good",
but still in every loop or if I commented.
